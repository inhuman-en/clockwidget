# Clock web component

A journey through the evolving webcomponents API with simple analog clock widget.
The idea is simply to evaluate acting webcomponents standard and to see if it is ready to use with no dependencies.

Ideally the clock is meant to be:
# Configurable (settable timestamp, hours, minutes, seconds)
# Scalable (width. height, responsiveness)
# Themable (not sure but would be fun)
